## Project Description

Topic: Politics and national hapiness


We are trying to find relevant datasets to analyse on a time relevant and socially relevant topic that affects countries in europe at the current time (See hypothesis and question below). 


<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions  


**Is there a correlation between the happiness of a country and the voting polls of extreme political parties?**

        1.1 Within a single country - introspective
        1.2 In comparison to other countries in the European union – external comparison (extrospective)
        


*Look for:*

        - Trends over time (two time intervals btw 2012 and 2019)

        - Countries of the European union: Spain, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Netherlands



**Hypothesis:**   

There is a negative correlation between extremism (both left and right) and the happiness of a country.


#### Extra Mile challenge:
        1.Extend to all EU countries  
          We had extened 5 more countries (Poland, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and France).
        2.Extend over a longer period of time
          As the Happiness index used different formula before 2010, we decided only use data from 2010.
        3.Trend prediction for future years
